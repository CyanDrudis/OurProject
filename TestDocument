Test Document for JUnit Testing

The Player class is the class that is thoroughly tested. 
There is testing performed on the Game class, although not thoroughly, important methods are tested. 

PlayerTest.java

Purpose: 

The player class contains methods that set and get a player's money and name, as well as methods that
deposit and withdraw money from their balance. Testing this class is important because these methods track the name
and money for each player, and in order for the players to have the right amount deposited into their balance
if they guess the right letters, and/or have the right amount withdrawn after guessing vowels, these methods must 
work correctly. In addition, special spokes on the wheel such as bankrupt which makes a users balance 0 relies on the 
setting money methods. As well, the final balance determines in the end who wins the game, so these instance variables 
must be storing the right values via the methods in order for the end game to be executed properly. This player class contains
two instance variables, balance and name which will store the values used to test the integrity of the methods.

Procedure: 

There are seven functions in the Player class.

getTotalMoney():

getMoney() and setMoney(): First the method is tested be asserting that the default balance is set to 0, shown by the
test_default_getter_money() test. Next, the getMoney() and setMoney() methods are both tested using the 
test_getter_and_setter_money() test, in which unique amounts are set for two different players using the setMoney() method,
and the getMoney() method is called to assert that the money set in the balance is the same as the money actually in the balance.
As well, the test_getter_and_setter_set_multiple_money() test is used to test whether setting a player's balance twice will 
overwrite the previous balance with the new set balance. 

getName() and setName(): First the getName() and setName() methods are both tested using the test_getter_and_setter_name() test,
in which unique names are set for two different players using the setName() method, and the getName() method is called to assert
that the name set is the same as the name in the instance variable. As well, the test_getter_and_setter_set_multiple_name() test is
used to test whether setting a player's name twice will overwrite the previous name with the new set name.
