Test Document for JUnit Testing

The Player.java class is the class that is thoroughly tested. 
There is testing performed on the Game.java class, although not thoroughly, important methods are tested. 

PlayerTest.java

Purpose: The player class contains methods that set and get a player's money and name, as well as methods that
deposit and withdraw money from their balance. Testing this class is important because these methods track the name
and money for each player, and in order for the players to receive the right balance if they guess the right letters, 
and/or have the right balance after guessing vowels, these methods must work correctly. As well, the final balance
determines in the end who wins the game, so these instance variables must be storing the right values via the methods
in order for the end game to be executed properly.
