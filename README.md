# OurProject
Our project is based on the game Wheel of Fortune as popularily seen on TV. 
Intention is to have everything run from Game.java but the interaction with the program occur in ConsoleUI.java. So a prospective user would not have to worry about the other java files. As it stands, July 22 2019, we have no actual input/output mechanisim working. The Game.java and Puzzle.java files are able to be compiled using the javac command in the command console, the ConsoleUI.java and runtime.java files are a work in progress to create a working text based version. README will be updated with instructions when we do have a comprehensive input/output working.
