Our project is based on the game Wheel of Fortune as popularily seen on TV. 

The text based version of the game runs through Runtime.java, while the GUI version 
runs through Main.java.
However, this project was primarily designed in Eclipse, therefore, there will be 
instructions on how to run the project in Eclipse and how to run it through the command console. 
As well the textfiles and the additional files that are downloaded in the OurProject Folder
must be in the same folder in order for the game to function.

In order to run the project in eclipse, the repository must be downloaded and unzipped,
a new java project must be created, right click the src folder, click import, then go 
into file system, click browse, and navigate to the unzipped OurProject folder, then into
the WheelOfFortune folder, click on the src folder, check the src folder, then click finish.
In order to run the text based version of WheelOfFortune, right click Runtime.java, navigate
down to run as, then click run as Java Application.   
In order to run the GUI based version of WheelOfFortune, right click Main.java, navigate
down to run as, then click run as Java Application. 

In order to run the JUnit tests, right click the name of the project, go down to properties,
click on Java Build Path, click Add Library, select JUnit and click Next, select JUnit 4 
from the drop down and click Finish. Next, right click the test file you want to use, 
named ...Test.java, navigate to to run as, click JUnit Test, and the test will run on the 
corresponding class.   

All the .java files should be compiled before running, using the javac command in the 
command console *(*.java)*
In order to run the text based version of WheelOfFortune in the command console, all files 
must be compiled, then the game is run using the command java Runtime. 
In order to run the GUI based version of WheelOfFortune in the command console, all files 
must be compiled, then the game is run using the command java Main. 

As well, in the OurProject folder, there is a sourcesForCPSC233Project, which lists links
of all the sources we've used.

There is also a TestDocument file which details how the JUnit tests were designed, including
the purpose and procedure.
