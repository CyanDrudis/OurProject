# OurProject
Our project is based on the game Wheel of Fortune as popularily seen on TV. 
Intention is to have everything run from Game.java but the interaction with the program occur in Runtime.java. 
So a prospective user would not have to worry about the other java files. 
As of July 26th, Game.java, Puzzle.java, Runtime.java and Player.java compiles, however, Runtime.java is not fully working. 
In order to compile, use the javac command in the command console. 
As well the textfiles must be in the same folder in order for the game to play.
All files must be compiled before running the text based version of the Game, using the command java Runtime. 
README will be updated with instructions when we do have a comprehensive input/output working.
