# OurProject
Intention is to have everything run from Game.java but the interaction with the program occur in ConsoleUI.java. So a prospective user would not have to worry about the other java files. As it stands, July 22 019, we have no actual input/output mechanisim working. README will be updated with instructions when we do have a comprehensive input/output working.
